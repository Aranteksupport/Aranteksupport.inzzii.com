## Welcome to your free trial

Welcome to Inzzii POS Free trial guided setup!
If you‚Äôve already registered for your Inzzii POS trial, then you‚Äôre ready to get started. If not please take the following steps;
 
* [Download the inzzii pos App](/docs/Chapter20.md)
* [Create Account with a Corporate Email](/docs/Chapter21.md)
* [Create a Branche in the app](/docs/Chapter22.md) 

##Set up your inzzii app Hardware
If you really want to take advantage of all the benifits of the app you should have a tablet with NFC. NFC can be used with our **in app EFT solution!!**. So **you dont need anny EFT hardware!!!**. 
We would like to inform you that the Pheriphial Hardware needs to live up to certain demands. When you want to connect for example a printer to the app, you need to have a Bluetooth or IP printer that is Epson TM80 compatible.
The drawer should be connected to your receipt printer via a special cash drawer connector, usually of RJ11 typ (looks like the old telephone connector). 
About EFT, at the moment we are very busy with implementing an integrated EFT solution in the inzzii app. We intend to have it up and running in October 2022.

## inzzii Webshop Manuals

We have two versions a basic one that only uses the app. But we also have a pro version that contains a webshop next to the app. But the both of them work in complete harmony with one another. The next manuals are informing you on how to set up your app with a inzzii webshop.
