## Hardware for inzzii POS app

If you really want to take advantage of all the benefits of the app, you should have a tablet with NFC. NFC can be used with our **in app EFT solution!!** So **you don't need any EFT hardware!!!**. <br>
We would like to inform you that the Peripheral Hardware needs to live up to certain demands. 
* When you want to connect for example a **printer** to the app, you need to have a Bluetooth or an IP printer that is **Epson TM-T88** compatible.
* The **drawer** should be connected to your receipt printer via a special cash drawer connector, usually of RJ11 type (looks like the old telephone connector). 
* About **EFT**, at the moment we are very busy with implementing an integrated EFT solution in the inzzii app. We intend to have it up and running in October 2022.
* To scan from the app you need to connect a **scanner**.

## Manuals for inzzii webshop

We have two versions, the **Basic Version** that only uses the inzzii POS app. But we also have a **Pro version** that contains a webshop connected to the app. The both of them work in complete harmony with one another. The next manuals are informing you on how to set up your app with your **inzzii webshop**.
If you want to check out the inzzii site and how your shop can look like, go here => [Inzzii Webshop](https://www.inzzii.com/).

<summary>Inzzii webshop Manual üöÄ</summary>
* [Setup Layout inzzii Webshop](/docs/Chapter30.md)
* [Configure Web Order Settings](/docs/Chapter31.md)
* [*How to set up Payment Methods for inzzii Webshop](/docs/Chapter32.md)
* [Configure General Settings for inzzii Webshop](/docs/Chapter33.md)
* [Inzzii Loyalty](/docs/Chapter34.md)

Now you have configured your inzzii Webshop, its time for the next step => selecting or deselecting the **Webshop Articles**. When you activate one of the Weborder Setting **all articles will be activated by default for this Weborder type**. But its up to you as shop owner to check if all can be sold for this type. Lets say that a glass of Cola can be sold with inzzii table but not delivered at a doorstep.

Another step that you need to take for all Webshop articles is adding a picture to them.
* <a href="docs/Chapter4.html#Images">How to set up inzzii webshop article picture</a>

Last step you can take is adding a long description and if needed an allergy specification.
