# How to set up Supplements
In this Chapter of the **Inzzii POS manual** we explain how to add supplements. A supplement is something that can be added to complete a thing. A Supplement is lets say a sort of a small article with a price that can be added to the 'main' article. Like ketchup or mayonaise to fries.  

## How to add a Supplement
