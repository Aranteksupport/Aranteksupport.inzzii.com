## How to set up Modifiers with Price

In this Chapter of the **Inzzii POS manual** we explain how to add a modifiers with price. A Modifiers with Price is to put it simple, an extra article. 
supplement you can sell items that are customizable or offer additional choices. is a something (most of the time a article) that can be added to complete a thing. For example, let’s say you’re selling pizza's that comes in multiple sizes. Your item variations would be the sizes => Small, Medium and Large. BUT, a Supplement is lets say a sort of a small article with a price. So a Small Pizza wont cost more, but Medium pizza will add 2,- Euro to the totel price and Large 4,- Euro.
