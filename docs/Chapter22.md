# Branch
This Chapter of the **inzzii POS Manual** explains on how to change or create a Branch. To simplify things we created a **default Branch that is a copy of your Corporate account data**. 
But as we tried to explain in the previous manual [Create Account with a Corporate Email](../docs/Chapter21.html) a Company doesn't have to be the same as a Branch.

## How to Change the Default Branch info
