# The different Payment Settings
> **note:** With the first three option on this page, a customer can **Pay Later**; he or she doesn't have to pay straight away at the checkout on your inzzii Webshop. With the other **Payment Methods** the customer can Pay directly in your Webshop. Please note that all these real Payment methods require an account with the selected provider.
