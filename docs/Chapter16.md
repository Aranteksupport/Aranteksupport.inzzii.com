# Tenders
This Chapter of the **Inzzii manual** explains how to change your **Tenders**. Standard you will have the **Cash Tender** at your disposal and active. But as you can see there are a lot of other Tenders in the list that are **Not Activated Tenders**. These Tenders only **become Active after you turned on the Function or implemented the Hardware**.
For example, you have to turn on the Voucher Function before the Voucher payment method becomes active or you have implemented the Castle Device before the Tender Castle EFT becomes active.
