1. Tap on the hamburger menu.
2. A sub menu will open => push on **Settings**.
3. The **General Settings** page will open automatically for you. 
4. **Language** => At the moment you can choose between 2 languages; English and Swedish. Soon there will be 3 newly added; Dutch, Danish and German.
5. **Popup condiments on new item** => When you have added Condiments and you want to always show these condiments for the articles when they are selected/added to the transaction, you need to activate this setting.
6. **Auto next on Max-choice condiments** => When you have created a condiment with a mandatory choices **and** activated that there is a maximum for these choices, this setting will automatically close the current condiment screen when the max is reached and go to the next screen for the article or close the condiments screen when it was the last one.
7. **Manual POS Keys** => This option gives you the power to design the inzzii POS app manually. 
>**Hint** The thing is that you should only activate this setting after you are **done** with adding all the groups, departments and articles. Because newly added ones will **not automatically appear** on the app screen anymore.
