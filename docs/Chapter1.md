# How to set up Tax settings
This is the first Chapter of the **Inzzii manual** because it's very important to set up the tax before any other step. Every country has it's own VAT settings and that's why there are no predefined taxes in the app.
> **Note:**  There are so called fiscal countries. These countries have extra, special tax rules. Shop owners must have a fiscal solution in these specific countries. An example of a fiscal solution is a so called blackbox (a piece of hardware connected to the POS where a copy of every transactions is stored). There are also online fiscal solutions valid in certain countries. At the moment the inzzii POS app is only **certified as Swedish Fiscal Solution**
