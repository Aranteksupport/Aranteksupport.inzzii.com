# How to set up Discounts
This Chapter of the **Inzzii manual** describes how to add the different type of discounts.
In general there are various types of discount; 
* discount on **article level** versus discount on **transaction level**.
* **discounts in percentage** versus **amount discount**.
* **fixed** discount versus an **open** discount.

1. Tap on the hamburger menu.
2. A sub menu will open => tap **Products**
3. On the left another menu will appear => press on **Discounts**. 
4. At the top a button called 'New' will be shown => push on **New**.
5. Add a **Description** for the discount you are adding.
> **Note:**  A good description is helpful if you will add multiple discounts. 
6. Choose the **Level** on which the discount is valid.
> **Note:**  An item discount is applicable for every article, a transaction discount for the complete transaction.
7. Choose the **Type**.
> **Note:**  Works in combination with your previous Type choice, for example => **Percentage on transaction** or **Amount for item**. There is one exception, an amount discount cant be given on a transaction. 
8. Select the **Sort**.
> **Note:**  When you choose Open, every time you select this discount a pop-up will appear where you need to fill in the discount. When it's fixed it will always be the same discount. You need to fill in this fixed amount or percentage in the next step.
