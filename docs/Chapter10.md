# How to view and create Reports
In this Chapter of the **Inzzii POS manual** we explain how you can create a X and Z-report and where you can see previous Z-reports.
> **note:** The difference between a X and a Z-report is simple, a Z-report is stored / definitive unlike a X-report. A X-report is a temporarilly created and not stored. If you for example made a Z-report at the start of ther day, you can press X-report in the middle of the shift to see what the sales are at the moment.
