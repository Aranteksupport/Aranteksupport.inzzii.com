## Users
This Chapter of the **Inzzii manual** will explain how you can add more users. **More** is explicitly written because at the initial startup of the inzzii app, a managing code had to be filled in for the main user => Manager. This user can do everything, has all the rights. Other users can have also managing rights or can have less rights.

## How to add a User
