# How to set up Users
This Chapter of the **Inzzii manual** will explain how you can add more users. More is explicitly written because at when the inzzii branch was started, a managing code had to be filled in for the main user => Manager. This user can do everything. Other users can have also managing rights or can have less rights.

## How to add a User
