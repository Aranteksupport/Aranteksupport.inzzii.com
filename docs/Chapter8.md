## How to work with a Table
Of course if you have a restaurant it is obvious that you work with tables. But tables is relative. You can replace the word 'tables' with 'bowling alley' or 'squash court'. As long as the have a different number you can work with the table logic. You book for example multiple times during a certain period, different transaction upon the table. The fist time some drinks, the second time some food and drinks and the third time some other drinks upon the table.
When they leave, the table with all the drinks and food will need to be paid.
