# Condiments Manual
In this chapter we want to explain how you should set up condiments. First, let us explain what condiments are in the app with an example. You have an article called steak, when you sell it you want the app to always show some options and or questions like;
- a choice inbetween different sauces => pepper sauce, garlick sauce or barbeque sauce 
- how the steak should be prepared => rare, medium or done 
- with fries or without fries
- extra mayonaise, extra salad or an extra sauce 

All these kind of questions/options you can add to an article with condiments.
In two previous manuals we have explained [How to add Modifiers](../docs/Chapter5.md) and [How to add Supplements](../docs/Chapter14.md). one or both of these two steps are required to create condiments.
