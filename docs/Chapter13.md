# Condiments Manual
In this chapter we want to explain how you should set up **Condiment Screens**. First, let us explain what condiments are in the inzzii app with an example. You have an article called steak, when you sell it you want the app to always show some screens with options and or questions like;
- a choice in-between different sauces => pepper sauce, garlic sauce or barbeque sauce.
- how the steak should be prepared => rare, medium or done. 
- with fries or without fries.
- extra mayonnaise, extra salad or an extra sauce.

All these kind of questions/options you can add to an article with the help of **Condiment Sreens**.
In two previous manuals we have explained [How to add Modifiers](../docs/Chapter5.md) and [How to add Supplements](../docs/Chapter14.md). One or both of these two steps are **required** to create condiments.

## How create a Condiments Screen

<img src="../Assets/Pictures/Hmenu.png" alt="hamburgermenu" width="25" height="25"/> At the top left of your inzzii POS app you have a hamburger menu 
1. Tap on the hamburger menu.
2. A sub menu will open => push on **Products**.
3. On the left another menu will appear => tap **Condiments Screen**.
4. At the top a button called 'New' is shown => press **New**.
5. Add a **Description** for the Condiment Screen you are adding.
6. **Minimum and/or Maximum Condiments**
>**Note** This option needs a bit of explanation
- If you want a condiment screen where you customer needs to make a choice you add **Minimum 1**. For example, Modifier 1 = "with fries" and Modifier 2 = "without fries" Combined in the Condiment "Fries" with a **Minimum of 1** makes that a mandatory choice needs to be made. It's not possible to order this article without answering this question / select 1 of the two options.
- If you want a condiment screen where you're customer has a maximum of choices, you add a **Maximum**. For example, you have 10 different Pizza toppings but a customer can choose max 3 toppings.
- Of course you can also use **Minimum and Maximum** both for one screen. For example a customer must choose 2 condiments => Minimum 2 AND Maximum 2.
7. Make a choice in-between **Condiment Type** => **Modifier or Supplement**.
8. Press **Add Condiment**.
9. Depending on your Condiment type choice, a list is shown you can choose from.
10. Select one or more from the list and **press OK to confirm**.
11. Tap **Save** to store.

And when you can copy this setup of screens to all other articles that need the same setup.

- **By Pressing Department** and selecting one you can filter the list.
- **By Pressing Article** and selecting one you can also filter the Overview.
