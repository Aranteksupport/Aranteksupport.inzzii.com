## Paying
Paying sounds easy but it isn't in a lot cases. You have one or more Tenders to choose from, a customer can pay the exact amount of money or more, 
different Tenders in one payment, different customers pay for one transaction/table (split payment) or a tip is given.  
> **Note;** In the previous chapters ([How to make a Transaction](/docs/Chapter7.md) and [How to work with Table Functions](/docs/Chapter8.md) we explained how you can arrive at this stage in the inzzii POS app.
> **Note;** Depending on the setting you chose for [Open Numpad](../docs/Chapter16.html) with this Tender, a popup will appear where you can enter the given amount.
