List Manual of awesome [Inzzii POS](https://www.inzzii.com/) applications either in *Action* or *Open Source*. The main goal of this repository is to find Website that used Hotwire in action, free open source Hotwire apps and *learn + start contributing* 🚀 .

I would say , this is also a [Gabi](https://arantek.eu) list.
